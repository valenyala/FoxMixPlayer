# Fox Mix Player
## Description:
This app is caused by a specific situation: when listening music on shuffle mode, it's common that some specific song of the list always comes back after some pieces of music. As it started to become annoying, I came to the idea of shuffle the entire playlist and listen to them with the shuffled order.
This way we can be positive that at least the same song we would not be listening to it until we have finished litening every song in the list. Reaching our goal simulating the "shuffle mode".
